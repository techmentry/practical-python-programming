# Practical Python Programming

Hello there student/ teacher/ parent(s) or anyone reading this text. We at Techmentry have tried to curate some basic information that you might find useful during and after this Practical Python Programming course. We want you to enjoy coding as much as we do, however, we do understand that it can be daunting and comes with a steep learning curve at the beginning. Having gone through it ourselves, we want to make this process easier and smoother for you. Definitely not spoon feed you, but point you to resources that we have found to be useful.

Python is used in a variety of domains - research in popular fundamental science spaces likes biology (stem cell simulation, genetic algorithms, understanding diseases, simulating and calculating artificial life etc), physics (universe simulations, optics, simulations for our own planet) and needless to say mathematics for almost everything.
It is also extremely pervasive in finance, banking, and in general an extremely handy tools while working with large data sets and repetitive operations.
Data science uses Python heavily now a days to generate reports, analyse data and create stats and build some AI models to take certain actions on these. Platforms like Raspberry PI, a micro-controller based embedded platform, allow you to program some cool IoT and robotics applications using Python and libraries like OpenCV for computer vision.

## What does this repository have?

This repository will have all the guides, source code, and setup manuals that you will need for the entire duration of the course. It is difficult to retain everything and even miss certain things with syntax or other technicalities, and that is where you can use this repository to help yourself.

## Site map

Here is a basic layout of what you can find, and where you can find it.

* Please check out the [setup](./documents/setup) page. This should hold all the software installation guides related to our course.
* Please check out the [guides](./documents/guides) page. This should hold all the knowledge guides related to our course and beyond.
* Please check out the [src](./src) page. This should hold all the source code and programs we will write during our course. This way, you have something to refer back to after.

## Where do I start?

I would recommend this order for the best results before our session.

1. Install Python. Please check this [guide](./documents/setup/python-setup.md) to find out how.
2. Install Visual Studio Code. Please check this [guide](./documents/setup/vscode-setup.md) to find out how.
3. Read up on command line basics. Checkout [this guide](./documents/guides/command-line-interface.md) we have curated for you.
4. Start reading up the code that we have in place for you. You can find all of the code divided day wise [here](./src/).

It is okay if you don't get all of this at once. We will try to tackle some of this during our sessions.

Hope to see you soon.

Best,

The Techmentry Team.
